        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  
  Answer: the 'this' keyword can point to different things depending on the circumstance. in essence there are 
  4 scenarios governing the 'this' command.

  1. Window Binding - if you use 'this' in a function attached to the global scope then 'this' will be pointing towards the window
  object. This is usally not something you would intentionally want to do. 

  2. implicit Binding - occurs when you are employing dot notation to invoke a function. So the general rule would be
  to look to the left of the dot, that will become the context for 'this'. 
  
  3. explicit Binding -  occurs when you employ call() apply() or bind() each of these methods has different properties.
  call() and apply() will both immediately invoke the function. You pass in 'this' bind() we pass in the arguements 
  one by one and the function is not immedietly invoked. bind() also returns a new function that can be assigned to 
  a variable and can be invoked later. 
  
  4. New Binding -
